As the embodiment of the teachings of the ancient sages and worthies of Confucius, Mencius, Zengzi and Zixi, they had long been venerated as sacred texts by Confucian scholars. They, however, did not form an organic set of philosophical treatises until Zhu Xi (1130-1200), the renowned Neo-Confucian great synthesizer in Southern-Song, grouped them together. Apart from giving them the specific format, Zhu also wrote them prefaces and commentaries, highlighting their themes and suggesting how they should be read and understood, as a result of which he produced the Collected Commentaries on the Four Books. Zhu\u2019s commentaries, alongside with the Books upon which they elaborated, were the most widely read and, thus, the most influential Confucian texts from the early 14th Century onward up until the early 20th Century. The significance they had attained in late Imperial China can be compared to that of the Bible in medieval and early modern Europe. Their popularity, of course, had much to do with the fact that they constituted the core of the official curriculum for the Civil Service Examinations during those six centuries. But, what is even more fundamental is that as the fruit of a lifetime search for the ideal personality, Zhu\u2019s Collected Commentaries was indeed a major source of inspiration for generations of Confucian gentlemen whose aspiration was nothing but to become a sage or a worthy. This course will guide students to read carefully through the lines of the Books, as well as those of Zhu\u2019s commentaries, to investigate into the following questions: 1) What actually it was that constituted the Confucian education program of inner-sageliness and outer-kingliness? 2) What were the concrete methods that had been recommended for the achievement of those aims?, and 3) What were the underlying assumptions on which the whole education program was predicated? It is expected that through examining these crucial issues, students will not only appreciate better the essence of the Confucian teachings of learning to become a sage, but also gain a deeper understanding of the philosophy that lies behind: the peculiar metaphysics, philosophical anthropology, ethics, social and political philosophies that characterize the Confucian tradition.", "Colist With Str": "-", "Vector": "-", "Previous Code": "-", "Offer In": ["2020-21 Spring", "2019-20 Spring"]}, {"Subject": "HUMA", "Code": "1010", "Title": "Introduction to Language", "Credit": "3", "Attribute": "(H)", "Exclusion Str": "-", "Prerequisite Str": "-", "Corequisite Str": "-", "Description": "An examination of fundamental concepts and principles in the scientific analysis of human language, especially concerning speech sounds, syntax, meaning, language acquisition, language processing, sociolinguistics and history of languages.

Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and variations, namely, robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk (e.g., CVaR or ES), regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix via random matrix theory, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, mean models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on R programming.

High profile incidents such as the A380 engine explosion in Singapore in 2010, and Deepwater Horizon accident were caused by undetected cracks in either turbine blades or pressure vessels. The importance of NDE is clear as it can avoid these risks by finding a crack in time. NDE is one of the key elements to ensure the quality of manufacturing and evaluate whether it is still safe to use an aircraft engine after many years. This course will introduce the basic ingredients of NDE techniques. We will cover different NDE approaches, including visual, penetrant, eddy current, x-ray and ultrasound. We focus on ultrasonic NDE because it is the most widely used, and it is very popular in the aviation industry (e.g. HASEL, HAECO in HK and Rolls Royce in UK). For ultrasonic NDE, we will start from very basic acoustic/ultrasonic knowledge to practical inspection methods and more advanced techniques. The lectures will be associated with real industrial application examples from my personal consulting experiences in the aerospace and nuclear industry.

It also provides powerful quantitative and rigorous approaches to the mechanics of materials. A brief and integrated view on various roles of defects in mechanics and physics of solids is established through selected topics. The basic concepts, equations and methods used in the mechanics analysis of various kinds of defects by continuum mechanics and thermodynamics approaches are introduced. Typical types of defects - cracks, dislocations, inclusions and inhomogeneities, grain boundaries and phase boundaries - are described intensively with illustrative examples provided. The applications of the theory in the mechanics analysis of fracture of engineering materials and solid-solid phase transformation process in smart materials and structures are demonstrated. This course is intended for graduate and senior graduate students who have a reasonable background in solid mechanics (such as theory of elasticity and plasticity, continuum mechanics) and material science. It can be used either as an introductory course for graduate students who study in solid mechanics and material streams in general or as special topics for senior graduate students whose research topics are related to the plasticity, damage, fracture and phase transition process of engineering materials. This course emphasizes basic principles rather than factual information. It will focus on the explanation of the basic physics ideas, hypotheses, assumptions and approaches in this subject.

Japan's success has been overwhelmingly attributed to its \"learning from the west\". The lack of appreciation of Japan's indigenous resources of economic and political development achieved before the coming of Westerners leads to a western-centered view of development. This course aims to place Japan's development after 1868 against the historical background of economic and political development in Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868). Against this historical background, it emphasizes multiple possibilities in the political development of Japan after the Meiji Restoration, foreign aggression was by no means the only path of Japan's political development. Japan's indigenous development of market economy, state-building, and local representative assemblies contribute significantly to Japan's rapid rise as a regional power in 1905 and a world power after 1918. This course will deepen students' knowledge of modern Japan, provide them with the analytic skill and critical thinking over the issue of Japan's political and economic modernization. By highlighting the parallel processes of military development and the development of democracy in Japan between 1895 and 1931, this course will help the students to have a better understanding of the rise and collapse of democracy in pre-Japan.
