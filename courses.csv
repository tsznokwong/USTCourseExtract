These suggest that conventional economic concepts need to be readdressed in order to analyze the microeconomic issues of housing. Besides, a significant number of households own residential properties by borrowing mortgages. A substantial collapse in housing prices might lead to negative equity for those households, and reduce their consumption and investment thereafter. Therefore, the macroeconomic implication of housing market dynamics cannot be overstated. The US subprime mortgage crisis during 2007-09 suggests that a sharp downturn in the housing market can cause negative spillovers to the aggregate economy. The first part of this course focuses on microeconomic issues like housing demand and supply analysis, models of housing market, rationales and effects of government’s housing policies. The second part emphasizes the macroeconomic issues such as the stylized facts on housing market dynamics, causes of housing market fluctuations, and housing market spillovers. Applications to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-2009 and housing markets in Hong Kong and China will also be addressed.

Commodities have taken an increasing importance due to the growth in emerging markets, issues over fossil fuels vs. renewable energy, the possibility of future inflation and the continuing financial repression on traditional assets. Trade finance, or financing for trade, is used when financing is required by buyers and sellers of physical goods to assist them with the trade cycle funding gap, or as a form of risk mitigation. Originally a bank internal activity, it has gradually muted into an asset class available to non-bank investors. Finally, infrastructure investing has emerged as a successful asset class amid strong demand for infrastructure investments and a deep need for infrastructure capital, also now accessible through various financial products to non-bank investors.  The purpose of this course is to give participants a good understanding and workable knowledge of the techniques that should be part of the toolkit of anyone investing in, trading, hedging, analyzing and/or advising private and institutional clients on these three alternative asset classes. Furthermore, this course will enable the participants to absorb the analytical arguments in the technical publications – the in-house research notes of financial institutions and in practitioner oriented journals – that deal with commodities and their markets, and to apply them.","-","[2-0-0:2]","-","['2017-18 Spring', '2016-17 Spring']"

Within this framework, three basic values will be explored: Economic development, legal justice, and social diversity. The first value explores the mindset of market efficiency and marketism in the pursuit of self-interest and material well-being of society as well as related controversy. The second value examines the competing perceptions of justice in law and beliefs. The third value relates to the complexity in racial, gender, and cultural diversity in various historical contexts.

These human identities and groupings are fundamentally informed by their historical past. This course is an exploration of human society through a historical analysis of the roots of these broad categories that we use to organize ourselves. The first value of “identity and community” examines the formation and changes in basic categories of differences in human society. These categories include ethnic, religious, and linguistic differences that gave rise to varying layers of identities that each individual may possess. Exploring the second value, “contact and conflict,” entails analyzing how these differences in identities caused competition over ideologies and resources. Finally, understanding the value of “justice and resolution” is an investigation of the ways through which human beings have devised ways to resolve conflicts and disputes within and between groups.","-","-","-","['2020-21 Spring']"

As the embodiment of the teachings of the ancient sages and worthies of Confucius, Mencius, Zengzi and Zixi, they had long been venerated as sacred texts by Confucian scholars. They, however, did not form an organic set of philosophical treatises until Zhu Xi (1130-1200), the renowned Neo-Confucian great synthesizer in Southern-Song, grouped them together. Apart from giving them the specific format, Zhu also wrote them prefaces and commentaries, highlighting their themes and suggesting how they should be read and understood, as a result of which he produced the Collected Commentaries on the Four Books. Zhu’s commentaries, alongside with the Books upon which they elaborated, were the most widely read and, thus, the most influential Confucian texts from the early 14th Century onward up until the early 20th Century. The significance they had attained in late Imperial China can be compared to that of the Bible in medieval and early modern Europe. Their popularity, of course, had much to do with the fact that they constituted the core of the official curriculum for the Civil Service Examinations during those six centuries. But, what is even more fundamental is that as the fruit of a lifetime search for the ideal personality, Zhu’s Collected Commentaries was indeed a major source of inspiration for generations of Confucian gentlemen whose aspiration was nothing but to become a sage or a worthy. This course will guide students to read carefully through the lines of the Books, as well as those of Zhu’s commentaries, to investigate into the following questions: 1) What actually it was that constituted the Confucian education program of inner-sageliness and outer-kingliness? 2) What were the concrete methods that had been recommended for the achievement of those aims?, and 3) What were the underlying assumptions on which the whole education program was predicated? It is expected that through examining these crucial issues, students will not only appreciate better the essence of the Confucian teachings of learning to become a sage, but also gain a deeper understanding of the philosophy that lies behind: the peculiar metaphysics, philosophical anthropology, ethics, social and political philosophies that characterize the Confucian tradition.","-","-","-","['2020-21 Spring', '2019-20 Spring']"

However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming.","-","-","-","['2020-21 Spring', '2019-20 Spring']"

"MAFS","6010R","Portfolio Optimization with R","3","-","-","-","-","Modern portfolio theory started with Harry Markowitz’s 1952 seminal paper “Portfolio Selection,” for which he would later receive the Nobel prize in 1990. He put forth the idea that risk-adverse investors should optimize their portfolio based on a combination of two objectives: expected return and risk. Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and variations, namely, robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk (e.g., CVaR or ES), regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix via random matrix theory, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, mean models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on R programming.

This introductive course on some modern topics of mechanics of defects in solids aims at providing a fundamental understanding and modelling tools of many physical and mechanical properties of solids. It also provides powerful quantitative and rigorous approaches to the mechanics of materials. A brief and integrated view on various roles of defects in mechanics and physics of solids is established through selected topics. The basic concepts, equations and methods used in the mechanics analysis of various kinds of defects by continuum mechanics and thermodynamics approaches are introduced. Typical types of defects - cracks, dislocations, inclusions and inhomogeneities, grain boundaries and phase boundaries - are described intensively with illustrative examples provided. The applications of the theory in the mechanics analysis of fracture of engineering materials and solid-solid phase transformation process in smart materials and structures are demonstrated. This course is intended for graduate and senior graduate students who have a reasonable background in solid mechanics (such as theory of elasticity and plasticity, continuum mechanics) and material science. It can be used either as an introductory course for graduate students who study in solid mechanics and material streams in general or as special topics for senior graduate students whose research topics are related to the plasticity, damage, fracture and phase transition process of engineering materials. This course emphasizes basic principles rather than factual information. It will focus on the explanation of the basic physics ideas, hypotheses, assumptions and approaches in this subject.

Japan's success has been overwhelmingly attributed to its ""learning from the west"". The lack of appreciation of Japan's economic and political development achieved before the coming of Westerners leads to a western-centered view of development. This course aims to place Japan's development after 1868 against the historical background of economic and political development in Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868). It emphasizes the contribution of Japan's indigenous market economy and state-building efforts to Japan's transformation. We will cover topics such as rural commercialization and the rise of entrepreneurship; the business ethics of Tokugawa merchants and its contribution to a market economy; the spread of mass education and its significance to political participation; and the mercantile economic policies of major domain governments as well as the shogunate's economic policy-making. We will also underscore the role of politics, examining how domestic politics impacted the process of learning from the west and how the struggle for a political system with more representation shaped the process of modernization. This course will deepen students' knowledge of modern Japan. It provides a more nuanced picture of its modernization, as well as highlight the multiple trajectories of development that were possible in Japan. Moreover, it will help them better understand the relationship between economic development and political participation through a concrete case-study, and allow us to rethink critically existing models of development.","-","-","-","['2017-18 Spring']"

This was Max Weber's question, posed most powerfully and succinctly in his classic work, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. We will engage in a close reading of the Protestant Ethic and related texts to discern Weber's argument. We will then evaluate his findings in the light of recent scholarship. Weber elaborated and tested his hypothesis concerning the role of Protestantism by examining a number of other world religions and ethical systems. We will concentrate on one of these, his study The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism. We will study this closely, comparing it with The Protestant Ethic, and seeing how far Weber was able to prove his case about the uniqueness of Protestantism.
