These suggest that conventional economic concepts need to be readdressed in order to analyze the microeconomic issues of housing. Besides, a significant number of households own residential properties by borrowing mortgages. A substantial collapse in housing prices might lead to negative equity for those households, and reduce their consumption and investment thereafter. Therefore, the macroeconomic implication of housing market dynamics cannot be overstated. The US subprime mortgage crisis during 2007-09 suggests that a sharp downturn in the housing market can cause negative spillovers to the aggregate economy. The first part of this course focuses on microeconomic issues like housing demand and supply analysis, models of housing market, rationales and effects of government’s housing policies. The second part emphasizes the macroeconomic issues such as the stylized facts on housing market dynamics, causes of housing market fluctuations, and housing market spillovers. Applications to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-2009 and housing markets in Hong Kong and China will also be addressed.

The focus of this course is how to derive econometric equations from economic theory and then use suitable procedures for estimation and inference. Students are expected to learn through examples from labor economics and development economics about these issues: what a complete structure is? To what do error terms in econometric equations correspond? How does structural estimation deal with unobserved heterogeneity, one important type of error terms? Then we would go back to the conceptual part and discuss identification, which one can better appreciate after understanding the basic ideas of structural estimation. The concept of identification and different identification approaches, and a combination of structural estimation methods and experimental (reduced-form) methods will be discussed.","-","[2-0-0:2]","-","['2016-17 Summer']"

"MAFS","6010R","Portfolio Optimization with R","3","-","-","-","-","Modern portfolio theory started with Harry Markowitz’s 1952 seminal paper “Portfolio Selection,” for which he would later receive the Nobel prize in 1990. He put forth the idea that risk-adverse investors should optimize their portfolio based on a combination of two objectives: expected return and risk. Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and variations, namely, robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk (e.g., CVaR or ES), regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix via random matrix theory, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, mean models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on R programming.

This introductive course on some modern topics of mechanics of defects in solids aims at providing a fundamental understanding and modelling tools of many physical and mechanical properties of solids. It also provides powerful quantitative and rigorous approaches to the mechanics of materials. A brief and integrated view on various roles of defects in mechanics and physics of solids is established through selected topics. The basic concepts, equations and methods used in the mechanics analysis of various kinds of defects by continuum mechanics and thermodynamics approaches are introduced. Typical types of defects - cracks, dislocations, inclusions and inhomogeneities, grain boundaries and phase boundaries - are described intensively with illustrative examples provided. The applications of the theory in the mechanics analysis of fracture of engineering materials and solid-solid phase transformation process in smart materials and structures are demonstrated. This course is intended for graduate and senior graduate students who have a reasonable background in solid mechanics (such as theory of elasticity and plasticity, continuum mechanics) and material science. It can be used either as an introductory course for graduate students who study in solid mechanics and material streams in general or as special topics for senior graduate students whose research topics are related to the plasticity, damage, fracture and phase transition process of engineering materials. This course emphasizes basic principles rather than factual information. It will focus on the explanation of the basic physics ideas, hypotheses, assumptions and approaches in this subject.

"SOSC","1000D","The Economic and Political Development of Modern Japan, 1603-1905","3","-","-","-","-","The rapid economic modernization and building of a modern state in Japan after the Meiji Restoration of 1868 has long been considered a typical case of successful economic and political development. Japan's success has been overwhelmingly attributed to its ""learning from the west"". The lack of appreciation of Japan's economic and political development achieved before the coming of Westerners leads to a western-centered view of development. This course aims to place Japan's development after 1868 against the historical background of economic and political development in Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868). It emphasizes the contribution of Japan's indigenous market economy and state-building efforts to Japan's transformation. We will cover topics such as rural commercialization and the rise of entrepreneurship; the business ethics of Tokugawa merchants and its contribution to a market economy; the spread of mass education and its significance to political participation; and the mercantile economic policies of major domain governments as well as the shogunate's economic policy-making. We will also underscore the role of politics, examining how domestic politics impacted the process of learning from the west and how the struggle for a political system with more representation shaped the process of modernization. This course will deepen students' knowledge of modern Japan. It provides a more nuanced picture of its modernization, as well as highlight the multiple trajectories of development that were possible in Japan. Moreover, it will help them better understand the relationship between economic development and political participation through a concrete case-study, and allow us to rethink critically existing models of development.","-","-","-","['2017-18 Spring']"
